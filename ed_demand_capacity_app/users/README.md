This is a 'users' Django application that deals with the creation of the custom user model and views related to authentication.

The code in this section is unfinished. 

I wanted an email field and no username field as I felt this would make more sense for NHS users who can then use their nhs.net email address to sign up; this meant a custom user field was required.

I believe I was following the code from https://testdriven.io/blog/django-custom-user-model/ and https://medium.com/@dakota.lillie/django-react-jwt-authentication-5015ee00ef9a.
